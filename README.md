RULES

- Internet and chatGPT are free game
- Cheating by walking over to another player and looking at their code is free game
- You are only allowed to push your own `name`.py
- You are not allowed to create any new files from within your `name`.py
- You are respectfully asked to keep the execution time of the benchmark cells in `testing.ipynb` under 30 seconds
- You are free to look at all code here. That means both the games and, once pushed, other players code (once pushed)
- If your code crashes or causes a crash due to invalid output, I will throw you out of that specific game, so no points that round

TIPS

- I expect time to be quite limited, so divide your time wisely between the games
- `testing.ipynb` is setup to be used during development. It allows you to test your code against 
- After the first round you can run `play.ipynb` to see how your code performs against the other players code from the previous round
- Ask me if you have any questions
