        In this game you pick between two options: "A" or "B".

        Each round point is granted to all players who choose the option chosen by the fewest nr of players.

        You receive a pandas dataframe representing the history of the game.
        The dataframe has a column for each player, and in each row the choice of the player in that round:

        These are dummy names and will be e.g. "ivo" "do" "carlos" in the scoring round.
        I advise you to deal with these names dynamically, as they are not guaranteed to all be present.

        The score in the example above would be:
        {'dummy1': 1, 'dummy2': 2, 'dummy3': 1}

        This game is inspired by the lightcycles in the movie Tron.
        These lightcycle bikes leave a wall behind them as they move, which kills you if you run into them.
        This implementation is grid-based; think multiplayer snake without food and tails that do not disappear.

        You receive a grid representing the current state of the game.
        This grid is a 2D array of characters, with the following characters:
        - " " represents an empty cell
        - "o" represents walls created by you
        - ">" or "<" or "^" or "v" represents your bike, depending on the direction you are going
        - "x" represents walls created by the opponent
        - "X" represents the opponent's bike

        Example input (5x5 grid):

        +++++++++++++
        +           +
        +     X x   +
        +   o   x   +
        +   o       +
        +   v       +
        +++++++++++++

        You die if you hit a wall, a bike, or leave the grid. So in this example,
        you are about to run into the bottom wall if you do not move right or left.

        You win if the opponent dies.

        Both players move at the same time.
        - If you both move into the same cell, you both die.
        - If you both die at the same time, it is a tie.

        Write a function that returns "up", "down", "left", or "right" based on the current state of the game.
        If you return the opposite of the direction you are currently going, you will keep going in the direction you currently are.

        The grid size and starting positions are always the same between games (7x7 and [(3, 2), (3, 4)])

        Good luck and be happy you are not actually trapped in a computer forced to compete to the death!

        Rock, paper, scissors, but with a twist!

        Each round is just like normal rock paper scissors, with the usual rules:
        - rock beats scissors
        - scissors beats paper
        - paper beats rock
        - if both players choose the same hand, it is a tie

        If you win a round, you get 100 points. Most points at the end wins!

        However, each round one of the hands is chosen to be the "wonky hand".
        If you win with the wonky hand, your points are multiplied by an unknown "wonkfactor".
        A hand can be:
        - wonk level "wonk": Points are multiplied by a random wonkfactor between -1 and 2
        - wonk level "turbowonk" (~25% chance): Points are multiplied by a random wonkfactor between -10 and 20
        - wonk level "hyperwonk" (~5% chance): Points are multiplied by a random wonkfactor between -50 and 100

        Finally there is a 20% chance the wonk level is "golden".
        In this case, the wonkfactor is the absolute of what it would have been - so always positive!.

        Each round you also get the complete history of the current game in a pandas dataframe.
        It has a row for each played round.
        It has the following columns:
        - `your name`: Your choice in this round ("r", "p", or "s")
        - `opponents name`: the choice of your opponent in this round ("r", "p", or "s")
        - `your name`_score: Your score after this round (int)
        - `opponents name`_score: the score of your opponent after this round (int)
        - wonk_level: the wonk level of this round ("wonk", "turbowonk", "hyperwonk", "golden wonk", "golden turbowonk", "golden hyperwonk")
        - wonky_hand: the wonky hand of this round ("r", "p", or "s")
        - wonkfactor: the wonk factor of this round (float)
        - rounds_remaining: the number of rounds remaining in the game (int)

        Note that `your name` and `opponents name` are the names of the players in the game and they and their order can change from game to game.
